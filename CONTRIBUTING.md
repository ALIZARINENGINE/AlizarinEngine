# Contributing to the ALIZARIN Engine

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We are thrilled to have you. This project is built by the community, and we welcome all help, from documentation fixes to core engine improvements.

Before you begin, please read our [**Code of Conduct**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## ⚖️ The Most Important Rule: Licensing

The ALIZARIN Engine is licensed under the **LGPLv3**. This is a "weak copyleft" license that allows our community to build and improve the *engine* while allowing creators to keep their *voice data* private.

* **Your contributions to this repository (the engine framework) MUST be licensed under the LGPLv3.** By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to license your code under these terms.
* **Do NOT submit your "secret sauce."** Do not submit your private voice data, texture kits, or formant scripts as part of a pull request.
